## Setup the AWS Cloud 9 Environment

### Install JQ

1. Open the AWS Management Console for [AWS Cloud9](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home/account). You will leverage AWS Cloud9 IDE throughout this lab for running scripts, deploying AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) templates, execute SQL queries etc.
2. Click on __Open IDE__ for the AWS Cloud9 IDE that was created as part of the Amazon Cloudformation teamplate that was deployed
3. Open a terminal window in the  AWS Cloud9 IDE by clicking on __Window__ from the menu bar on the top and select __New Terminal__
4. Copy and paste the command below in the terminal window to install [JQ](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) 

```shell script
cd ~/environment
sudo yum -y install jq gettext
```

### Update SAM CLI
   
- To update the AWS SAM CLI to the latest version copy paste the following commands in the terminal window in the AWS Cloud9 IDE
   
 ```shell script
cd ~/environment
pip install --user --upgrade awscli aws-sam-cli
sam --version
```  
> Note: Ensure that the SAM CLI version is 0.21.0 or above.

### Install AWS SDK for Python

- To install [Boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html?id=docs_gateway) (AWS SDK for Python) copy paste the following commands in the terminal window in the AWS Cloud9 IDE
   
 ```shell script
cd ~/environment
curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py # Get the install script. 
sudo python3 get-pip.py # Install pip.
pip3 install boto3 --user
 ```

###
1. Open the AWS Management Console for CloudFormation from [here](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-west-2).  
2. In the upper-right corner of the AWS Management Console, confirm you are in the US West (Oregon) Region.  
3. Click on __Stacks__ in the navigation pane on the right.  
4. Under __Stacks__ copy and make a note of the name of the Amazon CloudFormation stack (e.g. _mod-aa8afde9acf04c7f_) that was deployed in the previous lab.
5. Substitute the string (_substitute-name-of-copied-cf-stack-name_) in the command below with the name of the Amazon CloudFormation stack. 

```shell script
AWSDBWORKSHOP_CFSTACK_NAME="substitue-name-of-copied-cf-stack-name"
```   

6. Copy and paste the following commands in the terminal window in the AWS Cloud9 IDE to set the environment variable _$AWSDBWORKSHOP_CFSTACK_NAME_ . 

```shell script
echo "export AWSDBWORKSHOP_CFSTACK_NAME=${AWSDBWORKSHOP_CFSTACK_NAME}" >> ~/.bash_profile
. ~/.bash_profile
echo $AWSDBWORKSHOP_CFSTACK_NAME
```   

> Note: Ensure that the name of the Amazon CloudFormation stack that you deployed in the previous lab printed as an output in the terminal (e.g. _mod-aa8afde9acf04c7f_)

## Enable Amazon DynamoDB Streams
In this section you will enable Amazon DynamoDB stream for the Amazon DynamoDB Tables named _'aws-db-workshop-trips'_ that was created as part of the Amazon CloudFormation template.

- Copy and paste the commands below in the terminal window to enable streams for the Amazon DynamoDB Tables named _'aws-db-workshop-trips'_
```shell script
STREAM_ID=$(aws dynamodb update-table --table-name aws-db-workshop-trips --stream-specification StreamEnabled=true,StreamViewType=NEW_AND_OLD_IMAGES | jq '.TableDescription.LatestStreamArn' | cut -d'/' -f4)
STREAM_NAME=stream/${STREAM_ID::-1}
echo "export AWSDBWORKSHOP_DDB_STREAM_NAME=${STREAM_NAME}" >> ~/.bash_profile
. ~/.bash_profile
echo $AWSDBWORKSHOP_DDB_STREAM_NAME
```

> Note: The output will be similar to the following 
>```
>stream/2019-09-18T20:18:33.343
>```

Now that you have enabled the Amazon DynamoDB stream the next step is to deploy the AWS Lambda function that will process the records from the stream.

## Deploying AWS Lambda Function
In this section you will be using AWS Serverless Application Model ([SAM]((https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/))) CLI to deploy a Lambda Function within the same Amazon Virtual Private Network([VPC](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/)). The SAM deployment will also include a python interface to the PostgreSQL database engine as an AWS Lambda Layer. This Lambda function will read the taxi trip information from the Amazon DynamoDB stream as they are inserted / updated in the Amazon DynamoDB table ('aws-db-workshop-trips'). Only when a trip is completed (denoted by the _STATUS_ attribute in the trip item/ record) the function inserts information into a relational table (_trips_) in Amazon Aurora database. 

### Packaging the PG8000 binaries 

In this section you will download and package the binaries for [PG8000](https://pypi.org/project/pg8000/) - a python interface to the PostgreSQL database engine. The package will be deployed as an AWS Lambda Layer.

- Copy and paste the commands below in the terminal window in the Cloud9 IDE.

```shell script
cd ~/environment
mkdir pglayer
virtualenv -p python3 pglayer
cd pglayer
source bin/activate
mkdir -p pg8000-layer/python
pip install pg8000 -t pg8000-layer/python
cd pg8000-layer
zip -r pg8000-layer.zip python
mkdir ~/environment/amazon-rds-purpose-built-workshop/src/ddb-stream-processor/dependencies/
cp ~/environment/pglayer/pg8000-layer/pg8000-layer.zip ~/environment/amazon-rds-purpose-built-workshop/src/ddb-stream-processor/dependencies/
```

### Deploy AWS Lambda Function and AWS Lambda Layer using AWS SAM template
In this section you will validate the SAM template that contains the configuration for the AWS Lambda function and the AWS Lambda Layer. 


1. To validate the SAM template copy and paste the commands below in the terminal window

```shell script
cd ~/environment/amazon-rds-purpose-built-workshop/src/ddb-stream-processor
sam validate
```

> Note: Ensure that the SAM template is valid. Look for the following line in the terminal as the output
> ```
> /home/ec2-user/environment/amazon-rds-purpose-built-workshop/src/ddb-stream-processor/template.yaml is a valid SAM Template 
>```

2. To package the AWS SAM application, copy and paste the commands below in the terminal window. This will create a template-out.yaml file is the same folder and will upload the packaged binaries to the specified Amazon S3 bucket.

```shell script
cd ~/environment/amazon-rds-purpose-built-workshop/src/ddb-stream-processor
S3_BUCKETNAME=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name $AWSDBWORKSHOP_CFSTACK_NAME | jq -r '.Stacks[].Outputs[] | select(.OutputKey=="S3bucketName") | .OutputValue')
echo $S3_BUCKETNAME
sam package --output-template-file template-out.yaml --s3-bucket $S3_BUCKETNAME
```

3. [_Optional_]  Please take sometime to review the template-out.yaml file.

4. Copy and paste the command below to ensure that the packages have been uploaded to the Amazon S3 bucket.

 ```shell script
aws s3 ls s3://$S3_BUCKETNAME
```

> Sample Output: 
> ```
> 019-09-15 16:39:56      70451 14b63970e9437bf82ea16664d46a929e  
> 2019-09-15 16:39:56      71954 d3eec91527b02d78de30ae42198cd0c0
> ```

5. Set the variable from the output of the Amazon CloudFormation template that was deployed

```shell script
cd ~/environment/amazon-rds-purpose-built-workshop/src/ddb-stream-processor

AURORADB_NAME=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name $AWSDBWORKSHOP_CFSTACK_NAME | jq -r '.Stacks[].Outputs[] | select(.OutputKey=="AuroraDBName") | .OutputValue')
echo $AURORADB_NAME
AURORACLUSTERENDPOINT_NAME=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name $AWSDBWORKSHOP_CFSTACK_NAME | jq -r '.Stacks[].Outputs[] | select(.OutputKey=="AuroraClusterEndpointName") | .OutputValue')
echo $AURORACLUSTERENDPOINT_NAME
AURORADBMASTERUSER_NAME=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name $AWSDBWORKSHOP_CFSTACK_NAME | jq -r '.Stacks[].Outputs[] | select(.OutputKey=="AuroraDBMasterUser") | .OutputValue')
echo $AURORADBMASTERUSER_NAME
LAMBDASECURITYGROUP_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name $AWSDBWORKSHOP_CFSTACK_NAME | jq -r '.Stacks[].Outputs[] | select(.OutputKey=="LambdaSecurityGroupId") | .OutputValue')
echo $LAMBDASECURITYGROUP_ID
LAMBDASUBNET1_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name $AWSDBWORKSHOP_CFSTACK_NAME | jq -r '.Stacks[].Outputs[] | select(.OutputKey=="LambdaSubnet1") | .OutputValue')
LAMBDASUBNET2_ID=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name $AWSDBWORKSHOP_CFSTACK_NAME | jq -r '.Stacks[].Outputs[] | select(.OutputKey=="LambdaSubnet2") | .OutputValue')
echo $LAMBDASUBNET1_ID,$LAMBDASUBNET2_ID
```

6. Substitute the string (_substitue-with-the-password-of-aurora-database_) with password string (without double quotes) for the Aurora database. Copy and paste the commands to deploy the AWS Lambda Function along with the AWS Lambda Layer. The AWS Lambda function will read the taxi trip information from the Amazon DynamoDB stream as they are inserted / updated in the Amazon DynamoDB table ('aws-db-workshop-trips'). The AWS Lambda Layer include the [PG8000](https://pypi.org/project/pg8000/) - a python interface to the PostgreSQL database engine.

```shell script
sam deploy --template-file template-out.yaml --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM --stack-name SAM-AWSDBWorkshop2019 --parameter-overrides LambdaLayerNameParameter=aws-db-workshop-pg8000-layer DDBStreamName=$AWSDBWORKSHOP_DDB_STREAM_NAME SecurityGroupIds=$LAMBDASECURITYGROUP_ID VpcSubnetIds=$LAMBDASUBNET1_ID,$LAMBDASUBNET2_ID DatabaseName=$AURORADB_NAME DatabaseHostName=$AURORACLUSTERENDPOINT_NAME DatabaseUserName=$AURORADBMASTERUSER_NAME DatabasePassword="substitue-with-the-password-of-aurora-database"
```
>Note: This may take few minutes. Ensure that the SAM teamplate was successfully deployed. Look for the following line in the terminal as output
>```
>Successfully created/updated stack - SAM-AWSDBWorkshop2019
>```

7. Deactivate the virtual environment

```shell script
deactivate
```

Now you have successfully deployed the Lambda function.
 
 
 ## Taxi Ride Workflow
 In this section you run the python scripts to simulate the booking of a taxi ride followed by acceptance of the drive and completion of the ride by the driver. After the trip is complete you will run backend SQL queries to process billing and driver payments.
 
 ### Taxi Trip Booking Workflow
 
1. Copy and paste the following commands as a rider to book a new trip.
 
```shell script
cd ~/environment/amazon-rds-purpose-built-workshop/src/ddb-python-script/
python3 rider-book-trip.py
```

> From the output of the script make a note of the tripinfo value. You will be entering this value when prompted by the subsequent scripts. It a randomly generated string that uniquely identifies a trip. It will similar to 
>```
> 2019-09-15T20:41:30.455031Z,0724662
>``` 

2. Copy and paste the following command as a driver to accept a trip. The script will prompt for the 'tripinfo' value. Enter the value (without double quotes) from the output of the previous python script you just ran as a rider to book a new trip.

```shell script
python3 driver-accept-trip.py
```
 
3. Copy and paste the following command as a driver to accept a trip. The script will prompt for the 'tripinfo' value. Enter the same 'tripinfo' value that you provided as input to the previous python script you just ran as a driver to accept a trip.

```shell script
python3 driver-complete-trip.py
```


### Driver Billing and Payments

1. Copy and paste the commands below to connect to the Amazon Aurora database. Enter the password string for the the Aurora database when prompted.

```shell script
AURORADB_NAME=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name $AWSDBWORKSHOP_CFSTACK_NAME | jq -r '.Stacks[].Outputs[] | select(.OutputKey=="AuroraDBName") | .OutputValue')
echo $AURORADB_NAME
AURORACLUSTERENDPOINT_NAME=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name $AWSDBWORKSHOP_CFSTACK_NAME | jq -r '.Stacks[].Outputs[] | select(.OutputKey=="AuroraClusterEndpointName") | .OutputValue')
echo $AURORACLUSTERENDPOINT_NAME
AURORADBMASTERUSER_NAME=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name $AWSDBWORKSHOP_CFSTACK_NAME | jq -r '.Stacks[].Outputs[] | select(.OutputKey=="AuroraDBMasterUser") | .OutputValue')
echo $AURORADBMASTERUSER_NAME

sudo psql -h $AURORACLUSTERENDPOINT_NAME -U $AURORADBMASTERUSER_NAME -d $AURORADB_NAME
```

2. Execute the query below to review the trip information that you just completed in the previous section in the _trips_ table.

```sql
select * from trips;
``` 

> The output of the query should have at-least 1 row in the trips table, similar to the output below.
>```

3. Execute the query below to insert driver billing information for all the drivers, for the current daily billing cycle based on the trip information in the trips table.

```sql
insert into billing (driver_id, billing_cycle, billing_start, billing_end,  billing_amount, commissions, rides_total, description, billing_status)
select driver_id, 2, current_date, current_date+1, sum(total_amount), 0.8, count(*), 'billing cycle 2', 'completed' from trips                                        
where dropoff_datetime < current_date+1 and dropoff_datetime > current_date                                                                                             
group by driver_id; 
```

> The query should insert at-least 1 row into the billing table and the output should be similar to the output below.
>```
> INSERT 0 1
>```

4. Execute the query below to review the billing information that you just inserted

```sql
select * from billing where billing_cycle=2;
```

> The output of the query should retrieve at-least 1 row from the billing table, similar to the output below.
>```
>     id   | driver_id | billing_cycle |    billing_start    |     billing_end     |        billing_date        | billing_amount | commissions |   description   | rides_total | billing_status

from billing a, drivers b where a.driver_id=b.driver_id and a.billing_cycle = 2 and a.billing_status = 'completed' group by a.id, a.driver_id,b.payment_id, a.billing_cycle, a.billing_date;
```

> The query should insert at-least 1 row into the payment table and the output should be similar to the output below.
>```
> INSERT 0 1
>```

6. Execute the query below to review the payment information that you just inserted

```sql
select * from payment where description='Payment cycle Jan 2020';
```

> The output of the query should retrieve at-least 1 row from the payment table, similar to the output below.
>```
>     id   | billing_id | driver_id | billing_cycle | payment_amount |        payment_date        | payment_id | payment_status |      description

>  (1 row)
>```

7. Execute the following command to close the database connection.

```sql
\q
```

## Cleanup

1. Delete the SAM application. This will delete the AWS Lambda function and the AWS Lambda Layer

```shell script
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name SAM-AWSDBWorkshop2019
```

> Note: Please note that it may take more than 30 minutes to delete the Amazon CloudFormation stack as it may be waiting for NetworkInterfaces associated with the Lambda Function to be cleaned up. 

2. Delete all the objects in the S3 bucket you created as part of the Amazon CloudFormation template.

```shell script
cd ~/environment
S3_BUCKETNAME=$(aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name $AWSDBWORKSHOP_CFSTACK_NAME | jq -r '.Stacks[].Outputs[] | select(.OutputKey=="S3bucketName") | .OutputValue')
aws s3 rm s3://$S3_BUCKETNAME --recursive
```

4. Delete the DMS tasks and endpoints you created in Lab 1.

3. Delete the Amazon CloudFormation template.

 ```shell script
 aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name $AWSDBWORKSHOP_CFSTACK_NAME
 ```

CONGRATULATIONS!! You have now completed the lab.
